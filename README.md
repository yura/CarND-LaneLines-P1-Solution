Overview
---

Finding Lane Lines is the final project of the Lesson 2 of the [Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](http://www.udacity.com/drive). The goal is the take an image from the car camera e.g.:

<img src="test_images/solidWhiteRight.jpg" width="480" />

and find lane lines on it using Python and OpenCV library:

<img src="test_images_output/solidWhiteRight.jpg" width="480" />
